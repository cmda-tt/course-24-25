# Week 0

This week is used to prepare yourself for the Tech Track. Maybe you're not as confident with HTML, CSS and JavaScript yet, perhaps you haven't been following Blok Tech in your 2nd year and there is a certain gap in your knowledge. Have no fear, this week can be used to go from green to ready.

## What do I need to understand?

All of this can be very overwhelming, so we've written down a small paragraph on what we expect all of you to know beforehand so you can verify for yourself whether you're comfortably prepared.

We'll be building a visualization using __HTML__ and __CSS__. Both of these languages are paramount for this course. If you have no prior experience with these, we highly recommend you follow the above links to study. You don't have to be fluent, we're neither, and Googling solutions is literally our full time job description. We expect you to understand basic *syntax* and *semantic meaning* of HTML tags. As well as a basic *seperation of concerns* and *structure*.

For __JavaScript__, we'll assume you know how to embed a JavaScript file in your HTML and interact with the *DOM* (document object model). You're able to listen to *events*, such as a user clicking on a button, and handle those events in the JavaScript file. Some syntax knowledge here is required, such as knowing how to *declare variables* and *assign values* to them, as well as basic usage of *functions*

We use the latest version of Javascript, that is __E6__. We prepared some exercises (the __Prerequisites__) to practise some constructs you should master, such as the forEach()-method, writing functions with return values and working with objects. 

__Git__ and __GitHub__ are our means of *version control*. We can save versions of every state the code is in using the Git software. Git keeps a memory of every version the code was in between *commits*. We expect you to be able to use Git, as well as GitHub, to manage your code. Don't worry if the *terminal* is a bit scary, we'll do fine if you're using a *GUI* or Github Desktop.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a message so we can direct specific guidance.
